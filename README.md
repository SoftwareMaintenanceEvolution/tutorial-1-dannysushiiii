Hi! I'm Ahmad Irfan Danial bin Shuhaimi, a final-year Software Engineering student, and I'm taking the WIF3005 Software Maintenance and Evolution course as an elective for my last semester.

🤔 My expectations on this course ...
I’m really looking forward to learning more about the ins and outs of software maintenance and evolution in this course. I want to understand the challenges developers face when keeping software up-to-date and relevant, and how to do it effectively. I’m also curious about the impact of software changes on users and businesses.

🔭 I’m currently working on ...
Personal Knowledge Management Website for Educators, EduManage, which is my Final Year Project. My goal is to make a website that's user-friendly for educators to address their unique needs and streamline their workflows.

😄 Pronouns ...

⚡ Fun fact ...
I love everything cozy! Let it be my place, games, music, or food and drinks.
